    "You may be exploring correlations between brain statistics, between behavioral/clinical correlates, or across brain and behavior. With each brain statistic being calculated across many different ROIs, and with many behavioral correlates, you can generate scatterplots in _small multiples_ in order to see the range of correlations as efficiently as possible.\n",

However, `GGally` plot matrix objects don't behave exactly like single ggplots, so the syntax for modifying other plot aesthetics is slightly different.\n",

    "If you have already selected your behavioral/clinical correlate of interest, you may wish to show how it correlates with brain statistics across different ROIs.

    "The [`ggseg`](https://ggseg.github.io/ggseg/index.html) R package uses `ggplot2` under the hood to plot pre-rendered 2D shape-file brain atlases and color individual regions by statistics of interest.

    "`ggseg` is optimized for ROI-based visualization, not vertex- or voxel-wise. It stores its atlases as tibbles/dataframes with one row per region. You can `join` a dataframe of ROI-wise statistics onto the atlas dataframe, and then plot the augmented atlas dataframe with your statistic of interest mapped to `aes(fill = my_statistic)`. You can bind on whatever ROI-wise statistics you have, as long as the parcel names in your data line up with the parcel names in the `ggsegGordon` atlas dataframe. If certain ROIs appear to be missing data when you plot, you may need to do some light string manipulation to harmonize any misaligned parcel names.\n",

    "The `nilearn.plotting` library uses `plotly` and `matplotlib` under the hood to plot snapshots of 3D cortical surface visualizations. `nilearn.datasets` comes with a number of atlases; however, the Gordon atlas has not yet been implemented natively [^footnote1]. You can either import the atlas yourself as a `numpy` array of ROI codes (one per each surface vertex) or use an alternative atlas that has already been implemented. The example below plots simulated ROI-wise statistics for each parcel in the [Destrieux surface atlas](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/modules/generated/nilearn.datasets.fetch_atlas_surf_destrieux.html?highlight=destrieux#nilearn.datasets.fetch_atlas_surf_destrieux).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `nilearn.plotting` uses `plotly` under the hood to flexibly snapshot the underlying brain model each time a plot is called, it supports all six canonical hemisphere views: medial, lateral, dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior. However, it can only render one hemisphere/view at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nilearn.plotting` surface plots are optimized for vertex-wise visualization. `nilearn` stores atlases as 1D arrays with one row per vertex. Each row's value is that ROI's integer code, and all indices with the same code value thus belong to the same ROI. You can plot any array of stat values as long as the array has the same dimensions as the atlas. If you have a list or `pandas` dataframe column of one stat values for each atlas ROI label, you will need to iterate through the _atlas array of vertices,_ fetching the relevant stat value for each vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have that, you can plot stat values on the surface! Use [`plot_surf_stat_map()`](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/modules/generated/nilearn.plotting.plot_surf_stat_map.html#nilearn.plotting.plot_surf_stat_map), which will vary color with your statistic of interest if it's fed into the `stat_map` argument. While it sounds like what you want, don't use `plot_surf_roi()` for this because that function is designed for plotting arbitrary categorical colors to ROI definition atlases.\n",
