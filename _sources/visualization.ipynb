    "You may be exploring correlations between brain statistics and behavioral/clinical correlates. With each brain statistic being calculated across many different ROIs, and with many behavioral correlates, you can generate scatterplots in _small multiples_ in order to see the range of correlations as efficiently as possible.\n",

    "[`ggpairs()`](https://ggobi.github.io/ggally/articles/ggpairs.html) from the `GGally` package will produce a flexible scatterplot matrix for exploratory visual data analysis. The plot is a `ggplot2` object under the hood, so you can modify `theme()` elements. However, `GGally` plot matrix objects don't behave exactly like single ggplots, so the syntax for modifying other plot aesthetics is slightly different.\n",
