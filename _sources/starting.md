# Getting Started with ABCD 

To work with ABCD data, youâ€™ll need a few things: access to the National Data Archive (NDA), and an approved Data Use Certification (DUC). As a recent update, renewing DUCs will now require creating and registering an NDA study. 

## Accessing the NDA & getting an approved DUC: 
The ABCD Repro-Nim Workshop has a [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit) to requesting NDA user accounts and obtaining a DUC.  

For the official NIH instructions for accessing the National Data Archive (NDA), see [NIH Instructions for NDA access](https://nda.nih.gov/about/creating-an-nda-account) 

For an overview of the DUC and responsible data use guidelines, see: https://abcdworkshop.github.io/slides/ResponsibleABCD.pdf [2021 MDC ABCD Workshop].
