# ABCD Discussion Board

Do you have a question about working with ABCD data? Are you looking for research collaborations or have a resource to share? Visit the ABCD Discussion Board, hosted on github discussions:

[Discussion Board](https://github.com/now-i-know-my-abcd/docs/discussions) 


For more details about the discussion board, see below, as well as the pinned post on the discussion board. 

## Discussion Guidelines

### Data Use Certification

Access to ABCD data is limited to those with an active Data Use Certification (DUC). In accordance with this, do not post any data or restricted information from ABCD in this forum. For the full text of the DUC, see [full text ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nda.nih.gov/Documents/NDA+Data+Access+Request+DUC+FINAL.pdf) 

### General guideline/courtesy, comment guidelines

Be respectful of your fellow users, and of the forum. 

### Using github Discussions & Finding Posts

The search bar can be used to search posts by key words, and in addition, posts can be found by both category and label. In the search bar, you can enter a category, label, or both. You can also click a category in the left-hand bar to view all posts in that category. To the right of the search bar, you can also choose options such as filtering posts by the post date, labels, and whether they’ve been answered. 

### Discussion Categories & Labels

Please put your post within the most relevant category. Categories can be viewed in the left-hand bar of the discussion page. When you create a post, you’ll have the option to choose a category. The categories are:	

**Now I Know My ABCD Improvements**

- Discussion about the resource itself, what could be added, etc
- Suggest new labels or categories

**Research Collaborations**

- Finding other people who may be working on/interested in similar things

**Stats and Code Help**

- Asking for code for abcd processing/analyses, help with stats questions

**ABCD Updates**

- Sharing new ABCD-relevant news - info about new data releases, publications, other updates

**Resources**

- Boost ABCD-relevant papers, posters, workshops, and training opportunities (or cool new tools that might be helpful for working with abcd data!)

**Where in the World is…? (Help)**

- Looking for a specific measure? Wondering how to score a measure? Need more information on how an analysis in an abcd paper was done? 

Additionally, posts can be tagged with multiple labels. Labels can be viewed in the dropdown bar to the right of the search bar. At this time, admins will label posts with the relevant labels after posting. If you think we’ve missed a label, or a label is incorrect, let us know!

### Q&A Format, Choosing Answers

The “Stats & Code Help” and “Where in the World is…? (Help)” channels have answers enabled. This means that threads in those categories are set up as a Q&A - you can vote for the solution that you think is the best fit, and responses can be chosen as the “answer” to the original question.
