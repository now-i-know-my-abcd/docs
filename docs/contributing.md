# How to contribute

This reference book is maintained on GitHub, so you can contribute via issues and pull requests.

% Note to website editors: the README isn't included in the directories that jupyter-book automatically checks for updates when re-rendering the website.
% If you update the README, this page won't automatically pull the content and re-render the contributing page. 
% You need to make a dummy edit (add "TEST" or something on a line) on this page to force jupyter-book to re-render. Then remove the edit on this page and re-render again so that the README changes remain but the dummy edit is gone.

```{include} ../README.md
```
